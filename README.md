[![Standard JavaScript Style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](http://standardjs.com/)

Native typewriter effect, without compromises or dependencies.

[See a demo](https://chriscavs.github.io/t-writer-demo/) for ideas/examples.

## Why

Creating a custom typewriter effect can be cumbersome and time consuming.  However, most of the libraries out there are either slow, bloated with dependencies, or lacking in functionality.

T-Writer.js was designed to provide maximum flexibility and usability, while remaining fast and dependency free.

## Usage

Follow these steps to get started:

1. [Install](#install)
2. [Import](#import)
3. [Instanciate](#instanciate)
4. [Overview](#overview)
6. [Review Api](#api)
5. [Review Options](#options)

### Install

Using NPM, install T-Writer and save it to your `package.json` dependencies.

```bash
$ npm install t-writer.js --save
```

### Import

Import Heads-up, naming it according to your preference.

```es6
import Typewriter from 't-writer.js'
```

### Instanciate

Make as many instances of the Typewriter class as you would like.  Upon instantiation, pass in the target element that will contain the typewriter, as well as an options hash.

```es6
// target element  <div class="tw"></div>

const target = document.querySelector('.tw')

const options = {
  loop: true
}

const writer = new Typewriter(target, options)
```

### Overview (how to use)

To create a typewriter effect with T-Writer, you need to:

1. queue up actions
2. call the `start()` method

To queue up actions, use one of the [queue methods](#queue) in the API reference below.  You can chain methods together to keep code DRY.  See the [demo](https://chriscavs.github.io/t-writer-demo/) for examples.

Every action returns a promise, guaranteeing that only one action is running at a time.  This improves performance, since it eliminates the need to contantly check whether to continue to the next action.

The order of actions is preserved.  Simply call `start()` again to repeat the effect.  To clear the queue (effectively wiping the slate clean), use the [clearQueue](#clearQueue) method.

## API

Queue Methods:
* [type](#type)
* [remove](#remove)
* [rest](#rest)
* [strings](#strings)
* [clear](#clear)
* [then](#then)
* [queueClearText](#queueClearText)
* [changeOps](#changeOps)
* [removeCursor](#removeCursor)
* [addCursor](#addCursor)
* [changeTypeColor](#changeTypeColor)
* [changeCursorColor](#changeCursorColor)
* [changeTypeClass](#changeTypeClass)
* [changeCursorClass](#changeCursorClass)

Other:
* [start](#start)
* [clearText](#clearText)
* [clearQueue](#clearQueue)

### type (str)

* str -> `string`

Types the `string` given as an argument.

### remove (num)

* num -> `integer`

Removes the number of characters given as an argument.

### rest (interval)

* interval -> `integer`
  * amount of time, in milliseconds

Pauses the writer for the specified period of time.

### strings (interval, string1 [, string2, ...])

* interval -> `integer`
  * amount of time, in milliseconds
* string1 -> `string`
  * a string to be typed out

The writer will type out the first string, then rest for `interval` amount of time, then type the next string.

### clear

Clear out the writer by deleting each character.  

This differs from [clearText](#clearText) and [queueClearText](#queueClearText).  `clear` will delete characters one by one, according to the `deleteSpeed` specified.

### then (callback)

* callback -> `function`

Invoke the specified callback.

### queueClearText

Will queue the `clearText` action.  This differs from [clearText](#clearText) and [clear](#clear).  `queueClearText` will clear the text of the writer **instantly**, at the specified point in the queue.

`queueClearText` is the only way to clear the text of the writer instantly while it is running/looping.

### changeOps (options)

* options -> `object`

Will change the writer's [options](#options) at the specified point in the queue.  **These options will persist for all further runs/loops** of this particular instance.

### removeCursor

Queues a `removeCursor` action, which will remove the cursor until the next loop.

### addCursor

Queues an `addCursor` action, which will add the cursor back.

**Note**: if using the `animateCursor: 'none'` option, `addCursor` will not take effect.

### changeTypeColor (color)

* color -> `string`
  * any css color

Changes the color of the typed portion of the writer.

### changeCursorColor (color)

* color -> `string`
  * any css color

Changes the color of the cursor.

### changeTypeClass (className)

* className -> `string`

Changes the `class` attribute on the `<span>` element that wraps around the text of the writer.

### changeCursorClass (className)

* className -> `string`

Changes the `class` attribute on the `<span>` element that wraps around the cursor.

### start

Starts the effect.  The writer will go through it's queue of actions.

### clearText

Clears all text from the writer **instantly**.  This is not a queued action, therefore, it can only be called once the writer has stopped running.

Since this is not a queued action, `clearText` will never run if the [loop](#loop) option is set to `true`.  Use [queueClearText](#queueClearText) if you wish to clear the writer during a loop.

### clearQueue

Clears the writer's queue, as well as all text in the writer.  This is not a queued action, therefore, it will never run if the [loop](#loop) option is set to `true`.

## Options

It is not required to pass in options, as each option comes with a default:

```es6
const defaultOptions = {
  loop: false,
  animateCursor: true,

  blinkSpeed: 400,

  typeSpeed: 90,
  deleteSpeed: 40,

  typeSpeedMin: 65,
  typeSpeedMax: 115,

  deleteSpeedMin: 40,
  deleteSpeedMax: 90,

  typeClass: 'type-span',
  cursorClass: 'cursor-span',

  typeColor: 'black',
  cursorColor: 'black'
}
```

Explanation of each option follows:

general
* [loop](#loop)
* [animateCursor](#animateCursor)
speeds
* [blinkSpeed](#blinkSpeed)
* [typeSpeed](#typeSpeed)
* [deleteSpeed](#deleteSpeed)
* [typeSpeedMin](#typeSpeedMin)
* [typeSpeedMax](#typeSpeedMax)
* [deleteSpeedMin](#deleteSpeedMin)
* [deleteSpeedMax](#deleteSpeedMax)
classes
* [typeClass](#typeClass)
* [cursorClass](#cursorClass)
colors
* [typeColor](#typeColor)
* [cursorColor](#cursorColor)

### loop

Accepts a `boolean`.  

* `true` -> the writer will loop through it's actions on repeat
* `false` -> the writer will run just one time

### animateCursor

Accepts either a `boolean`, or a string of `"none"`.

* `boolean`
  * `true` -> cursor blinks (according to [blinkSpeed](#blinkSpeed))
  * `false` -> cursor does not blink

* `string`
  * `"none"` -> cursor is not added

### blinkSpeed

Accepts an `integer`.

The time between each blink, given in milliseconds.  **A lower integer results in a faster blink speed.**

### typeSpeed

Accepts either an `integer`, or a string of `"random"`.

* `integer`
  * The time between typing a letter and typing the next, given in milliseconds.  **A lower integer results in a faster type speed.**
* `string`
  * `"random"` -> constantly re-evaluates the speed based on the [typeSpeedMin](#typeSpeedMin) and [typeSpeedMax](#typeSpeedMax).  Used for a more 'human' typing effect.

### deleteSpeed

Accepts either an `integer`, or a string of `"random"`.

* `integer`
  * The time between deleting a letter and deleting the next, given in milliseconds.  **A lower integer results in a faster delete speed.**
* `string`
  * `"random"` -> constantly re-evaluates the speed based on the [deleteSpeedMin](#deleteSpeedMin) and [deleteSpeedMax](#deleteSpeedMax).  Used for a more 'human' typing effect.

### typeSpeedMin

Accepts an `integer`.

The minimum type speed, applicable only if using `typeSpeed: "random"`.

### typeSpeedMax

Accepts an `integer`.

The maximum type speed, applicable only if using `typeSpeed: "random"`.

### deleteSpeedMin

Accepts an `integer`.

The minimum delete speed, applicable only if using `deleteSpeed: "random"`.

### deleteSpeedMax

Accepts an `integer`.

The maximum delete speed, applicable only if using `deleteSpeed: "random"`.

### typeClass

Accepts a `string`.

The class given to the `<span>` element that wraps around the typed portion of the writer.  Use this option to specifically style the text of the writer.

### cursorClass

Accepts a `string`.

The class given to the `<span>` element that wraps around the cursor portion of the writer.  Use this option to specifically style the cursor of the writer.

### typeColor

Accepts a `string` of any CSS color (rbg, 'white', etc).

Applies an inline-style to the `<span>` element that wraps around the text portion of the writer.

### cursorColor

Accepts a `string` of any CSS color (rbg, 'white', etc).

Applies an inline-style to the `<span>` element that wraps around the cursor portion of the writer.
